# mpptChgD configuration file
#
# Configure the following optional functions:
#   1. Auto shutdown enable
#   2. TCP Access
#   3. Charger register value Logging
#   4. Charger configuration parameters
#   5. Watchdog enable
#
# All options shown below. Uncomment to enable. Configuration items have the form
# <ITEM>=<VALUE> where <VALUE> may be an integer or string value.  Items that are
# used to enable functionality (such as SHUTDOWN below) may either be commented out
# or set to 0 to disable.  Uncomment them and set the value to 1 to enable.
#
# Comments are indicated by a '#' or ';' character in the first position.
#

# Automatic Low Battery shutdown.  Uncomment the following line to enable a controlled
# OS shutdown upon detection of an imminent power down due to low battery.
SHUTDOWN=1

# Automatic Night shutdown.  Uncomment the following line to enable a controlled
# OS shutdown upon detection of night.
# Time specified is watchdog power off time
SHUTDOWN_NIGHT_TIME_OFF=0
#1800 # every 3h we wake up to see if night still there
# Time after first detection to power off
# Set 0 to power off when night is detected otherwise set number of seconds before
# next check. If it is night during the second check, it powers off
SHUTDOWN_NIGHT_TIME_BEFORE_OFF=600 
# check next night in 10 minutes

# Remote TCP access.  Uncomment and set the TCP_PORT to a non-zero number to enable
# TCP access to the daemon.
TCP_PORT=23000
# Maximum number of simultaneous TCP connections (default is 1 connection, maximum 4)
TCP_MAX=4

# Logging parameters
#
# Configure the logfile
LOG_FILE=/home/valentin/logs/mpptChgD.log
#
# Number of seconds between log entries
LOG_DELAY=60
#
# Log items.  Uncomment charger register values you wish to log.  Important to note that items
# are logged in the following order, even if the actual enable lines in this file are re-ordered.
# Items that are not enabled are skipped.  See the user manual for an explanation of each register.  No log file is generated if all LOG items are commented out.
# Values are logged as base-10 decimal numbers separated by a space character.
#   ID, STATUS, BUCK, VS, IS, VB, IB, IC, IT, ET, VM, TH, BULKV, FLOATV, PWROFFV, PWRONV, WDEN, WDCNT

# Watchdog Enable.  Uncomment the following line to enable the daemon to control the charger's
# watchdog mechanism.  It will enable the watchdog functionality and make sure that it is
# updated in order to not cycle power.  The daemon will catch most terminal signals and
# automatically disable the watchdog before exiting.  However a hard kill of the daemon will
# leave the watchdog running and unless it is disabled via another facility, the charger will
# power cycle the system within 120 - 180 seconds.
WATCHDOG=1
